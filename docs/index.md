# Project Portfolio
## Project: Amazon Clone
[Amazon Clone](https://clone-124e6.web.app/) is a web application developed using React, with a Google Firebase back-end. This project was developed throughout the winter break in my third year of studies as a computer science undergraduate.

The purpose of this project is to explore full-stack web development, which we are not exposed to during the course of our studies.
